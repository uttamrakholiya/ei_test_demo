	<p>Lights go out and I can't be saved <br />
	Tides that I tried to swim against  <br />
	Brought me down upon my knees  <br />
	Oh I beg, I beg and plead </p>

	<p>Singin', come out if things aren't said  <br />
	Shoot an apple off my head  <br />
	And a, trouble that can't be named  <br />
	Tigers waitin' to be tamed </p>

	<p>Singing, yooooooooooooo ohhhhhh  <br />
	Yoooooooooooo ohhhhhh </p>

	<p>Home, home, where I wanted to go <br /> 
	Home, home, where I wanted to go  <br />
	Home, home, where I wanted to go  <br />
	Home, home, where I wanted to go</p>
